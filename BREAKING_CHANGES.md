# 0.3.0

- The registerTasks method has now removed. Instead, the main export is a function that you call, and you must pass along your version of gulp as well.
```
	var gulp = require('liferay-gulp-tasks')(require('gulp'), options);
```

# 0.2.0

- The default repositories ids have been changed to stay consistent with their urls. Now, ids are:
    - liferay-releases-ce
    - liferay-snapshots-ce

Any `.m2/settings.xml` file keeping server information for this should be updated to reflect the new ids.
